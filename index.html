Strong interaction is one of the four <a target="_blank" class="blau" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction"><b>fundamental forces of nature</b></a>. Quantum effects but also relativity are crucial for the understanding of strongly interacting particles -- <b>hadrons</b> such as protons, etc.. The way to reconcile both is the so-called Quantum Field Theory, which for the strong interaction is called <a target="_blank" class="blau" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics"><b>Quantum Chromodynamics</b></a> (<b>QCD</b>).

<br><br>
This theory has several unusual properties rooted deeply in its non-trivial mathematical structure. For example, protons are build up of 3 quarks, but have a mass hundred times larger than the sum of quark masses. Thus, the largest part of our mass and that of all visible Universe -- is due to QCD.

<br><br>
Hadrons don't exist only in the ground state but can be excited in e.g. scattering experiments. Such excited states decay very quickly, but the pattern of their existance and appearance is probably our best clue in understanding the QCD. The summary of our current knowledge about these and other states of matter is collected by the <a target="_blank" class="blau" href="http://pdglive.lbl.gov/Viewer.action"><b>Particle Data Group</b></a>.

<br><br>
Unraveling the pattern of excited hadrons is the golden thread through my research, connecting methods from S-matrix theory, effective field theories, numerical techniques of Lattice QCD, statistics, etc.. The links below will lead you to my publications available as open source aricles on <a target="_blank" class="blau" href="https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=%22maxim+mai%22&terms-0-field=author&classification-physics_archives=all&classification-include_cross_list=include&date-filter_by=all_dates&date-year=&date-from_date=&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date&abstracts=show&size=50&order=-announced_date_first"><b>arXiv</b></a>.

<h6>-- Lattice QCD --</h6>

<p>
Hadron spectroscopy from QCD is currently only accesible within the Lattice Gauge Theory. There, in large-scale numerical calculations, hadrons and intereactions thereof can be studies in scenarios which may even be inaccessible by the experiments. Thus, Lattice QCD is more than a complementing tool to experiments but truly a theoretical framework to QCD (?link?).

<br><br>
Lattice computations are necesarily performed on discretized Eucledean space time in a finite box. Both these technical limitations needs to be lifted when comparing the results of Lattice QCD with phenomenological observations. The discretization effects are well under controll, dealt with continuum extrapolations. Mathematically more intricate and interesting effects arise from the finitness of the lattice setup -- the so-called <b>finite volume effects</b>. At the core, the issue is that a finite coordinate space induces the need for boundary conditions. This induces the discretization of the momentum-space and the spectrum of the QCD Hamiltonian -- see figure below.

The so-called quantization condition aims to bridge these two worlds -- finite and infinite volume results. While the general form of such condition is not known, there is a large interest in understanding three hadrons in the finite volume. This will open the door to tackle several puzzles of modern hadron physics. Recent international workshop dedicated to this area of research has been held at the Bethe-Center in for Theoretical Physics in Bonn (Germany) - <a target="_blank" class="blau" href="https://indico.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/event/2/page/2-home"><i>"Multihadron Dynamics in a Box"</i></a>.
In recent years, I have worked on the derivation of <b>three-body quantization condition</b>, the corresponding infinite-volume amplitude, and applications to physical three-body systems calculated on the lattice:

In many lattice calculations the pion mass is higher than the physical one for performance reasons. This technicality needs to be overcome (in addition to infinite volume mapping and continumm extrapolations) when comparing lattice results to the physical ones. Chiral Perturbation Theory (see below) dictates the pion mass dependence of QCD Green's functions allowing for the so-called <b>chiral extrapolations</b>.

<hr><!-- %%%%%%%%%%% Resonances %%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

<h6>-- Resonances --</h6>

Excited hadrons manifest themself in various ways observable in, e.g., scattering or photoproduction experiments as an excess in cross-section rate. However, this depends on various factors and on the type of experiment. Universal properties of such states -- <b>resonances</b> can be extracted from the scattering amplitude extrapolated to complex energies. In a nutshell, given an analytic form of the scattering amplitude fixed by the experimental data at real energies, one extrapolates it to the complex energy plane. The latter so-called Riemann surface is in general a non-trivial manifold consisitng of muplitple (2^N, for N thresholds) Riemann sheets, each spanning over the whole complex energy plane. The first Riemann sheet is a pole-free surface, while the others can have poles. These poles are associated with the resonances, which mass and width are exactly fixed by the complex-energy pole position. These both charachteristics of an excited state are independent of the exact production setup.

Of large interest is the so-called <b>Lambda 1405</b> resonance with quantum numbers I=0, S=-1. It is important not only for testing of our understanding of low-energy QCD, but also in explaining novel states of matter searched for in J-PARC, GSI and DAFNE experimental facilities. It may, furthermore, be one of crucial vehicles for explanation of the stiffness of the equation of state of neutron stars, thus, being of interest for applications in Astrophysics.
