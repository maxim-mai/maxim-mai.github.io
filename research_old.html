  Strong interaction is one of the four <a target="_blank" class="blau"
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction">
  <b>fundamental interactions of nature</b></a>. Strongly interacting particles are called <b>hadrons</b> such as
  protons, neutrons, pions, etc.. Similarly to the excitations of atoms (see visible spectrum of hydrogen below)
  hadrons do not exist only in the ground state but can be excited in scattering or production experiments.

  The excited hadrons decay very quickly into energetically lower states. But the pattern of their
  existence and appearance is universal and probably our best clue in understanding of the
  strong interaction and the origin of matter. The summary of humanity's current state of
  knowledge is collected by the <a target="_blank" class="blau" href="http://pdglive.lbl.gov/Viewer.action"><b>Particle Data Group</b></a>.


  Quantum effects but also relativity are crucial for the understanding of hadrons.
  The way to reconcile both is the so-called Quantum Field Theory, which for the strong
  interaction is called <a target="_blank" class="blau"
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics">
  <b>Quantum Chromodynamics (<b>QCD</b>)</b></a>.

  <br><br>
  This theory has several unusual properties rooted in its non-trivial mathematical structure.
  For example, protons are build up of three quarks, but have a mass hundred times larger than the sum of quark masses. Thus, the largest part of our mass and that of all visible Universe -- is due to QCD.   Unraveling the pattern of excited hadrons is the golden thread through my research, connecting methods from S-matrix theory, effective field theories, numerical techniques of Lattice QCD, statistics, etc..

  Excited hadrons manifest themselves in various ways observable in, e.g., scattering or photoproduction experiments as an excess in cross-section rate. However, this depends on various factors and on the type of experiment. <b>Universal properties of resonances</b> (excited hadrons) can be extracted from the scattering amplitude extrapolated to complex energies.

  In a nutshell, given an analytic form of the scattering amplitude fixed by the experimental data at real energies, one extrapolates it to the complex energy plane. The latter so-called Riemann surface is in general a non-trivial manifold consisting  of multiple (2<sup>N</sup>, for N production thresholds) Riemann sheets, each spanning over the whole complex energy plane. The first Riemann sheet is a pole-free surface, while the others can have poles. These poles are associated with the resonances (see Figure below), whose mass and width are exactly fixed by the complex-energy pole position. These both characteristics of an excited state are independent of the exact production setup.

  One interesting state is the <b>Lambda 1405</b> resonance
  with quantum numbers I=0, S=-1. It is important not only for testing
  of our understanding of low-energy QCD, but also in explaining
  novel states of matter searched for in J-PARC, GSI and DAFNE
  experimental facilities. It may, furthermore, be one of vehicles for
  explanation of the stiffness of the equation of state of neutron stars,
  thus, being of interest for applications in Astrophysics. For more details

  I am working on extraction of universal parameters of resonances using experimental scattering, photoproduction, electroproduction or lattice QCD results. Some of those states are N<sup>*</sup>(1535), N<sup>*</sup>(1650) (lowest S-wave excitations of nucleon), &rho;(770), &sigma;(500) (lightest unstable hadrons), a<sub>1</sub>(1260) (axial meson resonance decaying in &pi;&pi;&pi;), &Lambda;(1405) and &Sigma;(1385).

  Hadron spectroscopy from QCD is currently only accessible
  within the Lattice Gauge Theory. There, in large-scale
  numerical calculations, hadrons and interactions  thereof
  can be studied in scenarios which may even be inaccessible
  by the experiments. Thus, Lattice QCD is more than a complementing
  tool to experiments but truly a theoretical approach to QCD.


  <h3>Finite volume effects -- Quantization</h3>

  Lattice computations are necessarily performed on discretized
  Eucledean space time in a finite box. Both these technical
  limitations need to be lifted when comparing the results of
  Lattice QCD with phenomenological observations. The discretization
  effects are well under control, dealt with continuum extrapolations.
  Mathematically more intricate and interesting effects arise from
  the finiteness  of the lattice setup -- the so-called <b>finite-volume effects</b>. At the core, the issue is that a finite
  coordinate space induces the need for boundary conditions, which
  induces the discretization of the momentum-space and the spectrum
  of the QCD Hamiltonian -- see figure below.

  The so-called <b>quantization condition</b> aims to bridge these
  two worlds -- finite and infinite volume results. While the
  general form of such a condition is not known, there is a large
  interest in understanding three hadrons in the finite volume.
  This will open the door to tackle several puzzles of modern
  hadron physics. Recent international workshop dedicated to
  this area of research has been held at the Bethe-Center in
  for Theoretical Physics in Bonn (Germany) -

  quantization condition</b>, the corresponding infinite-volume
  amplitude, and applications to physical three-body systems

  Another methods may exist in extracting bulk properties of infinite volume quantities from a

  <h3>Unphysical pion mass -- a chance and a challenge</h3>

  In many lattice calculations the pion mass is higher than the physical one for techniqual reasons.
  This technicality needs to be overcome (in addition to infinite volume mapping and continuum extrapolations)
  when comparing lattice results to the physical ones. On the other side, it also is a chance to explore the
  structure of QCD promoting a pion mass to a continious parameter, and exploring our understanding in this
  orthogonal to the energy dimension.

  Many of these methods are rooted in S-matrix theory and previously derived
  scattering amplitudes from effective field theories and chiral perturbation theory
